## Combine Basic

### What is Combine?

Combine is a framework that provides a declarative Swift API for procesing values over time. These values can represent many kinds of asynchronous events, like network responses, user input, timers, and more.

### Publishers and Subscribers

**Publisher**: A type that produces a sequence of values over time.

**Subscriber**: A type that can receive input from a publisher.

## Basic Workflow
1. A publisher emits values.
2. Operators can transform, filter, or combine the values.
3. A subscriber receives the processed values.

## Simple Example: Basic Publisher and Subscriber

Here's simple example using a 'Just' publisher, whch emits a single value and then finishes.


```swift
import Combine

// Create a Just publisher that emits a single value
let publisher = Just("Hello, Combine!")

// Create a subscriber using sink to handle the received
let cancellable = publisher.sink { value in
    print("Received value: \(value)")
}

// Output:
// Received value: Hello, Combine!
```

### Handling Multiple Values

You can use other types of publishers that emit multiple values, like an array publisher.

```swift
import Combine

// Create a publisher that emits multiple values from an array
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].publisher

// Create a subscriber using sink to handle the received values
let cancellable = numbers.sink { value in
    print("Received value: \(value)")
}
```

### Using Subjects
Subjects act as both publishers and subscribers. They allow you to manually send values.

```swift
import Combine

// Create a PassthroughSubject
let subject = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()

// Create a subscriber using sink to handle the received values
let cancellable = subject.sink { value in
    print("Received value: \(value)")
}

// Send values to the subject
subject.send("Hello")
subject.send("Combine")

// Output:
// Received value: Hello
// Received value: Combine
```
